        <h1>Elvis Presley</h1>
        <p> Elvis Aaron Presley[a] (January 8, 1935 â€“ August 16, 1977), often referred to mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the "King of Rock and Roll", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century
            He is considered as the god of the rock music scene. every concert of his raked millions. every tune of his rocked the stage. even michael jackson couldn't become half of what elvis had been. he collaborated with a lot of indie singers and independent bands and helped them
        he has released almost 700 albums solely under his name unlike other stars of his time who were behind music labels and other companies
      my personal favourite songs of elvis are "clambake", "speedway" , "Double trouble" </p>
